# Gantral Agent Guidelines
This repository uses a **Memory Bank** pattern.
- **Context**: stored in `.agent/memory_bank/`
- **Rules**: stored in `.cursor/rules/`
- **Prompts**: stored in `.agent/prompts/`

**CRITICAL RULE**: Before starting ANY task, you MUST read `.agent/memory_bank/activeContext.md` to understand the current state. When finishing a task, you MUST update that file.
