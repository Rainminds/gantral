# Contributing to Gantral

## New Contributors / Interns

If you are new to Gantral or new to open-source infrastructure projects, start here.

Recommended first contributions:
- Documentation improvements (README clarity, diagrams, examples)
- Improving or expanding example workflows
- Small, well-scoped fixes or refactors
- Adding comments or tests to existing code

Look for issues labeled:
- `good-first-issue`
- `docs`
- `examples`

If you are unsure where to start, open an issue or comment on an existing one, we are happy to guide first-time contributors.

Small, well-reviewed contributions are preferred over large, rushed changes.
