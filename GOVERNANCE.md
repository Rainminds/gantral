# Gantral Governance

## Overview
Gantral is a "Maintainer-Led" project initiated by Rainminds. We follow a benevolent dictator model where the core maintainers have final say on the roadmap, but we welcome community input via RFCs.

## Roles
- **Contributors:** Anyone who submits a PR or issue.
- **Maintainers:** Individuals with write access and voting rights on architectural decisions.
- **Admins:** Rainminds engineering leadership (Roadmap owners).

## Decision Making
- **RFC Process:** Major architectural changes must follow the RFC process (see `specs/README.md`).
- **Consensus:** We strive for consensus, but Admins have the tie-breaking vote if necessary to maintain velocity.

## Code of Conduct
We follow the CNCF Code of Conduct.
