# Welcome to Gantral

**Gantral** is the open-source **AI Execution Control Plane**. It allows teams and enterprises to standardize, govern, and audit AI agent workflows across teams.

> **"We don’t help you build agents. We help you run AI safely across your organization."**

## Quick Start
*   **[What is Gantral?](./positioning/what-is-gantral.md)**: High-level overview and philosophy.
*   **[Product Spec](./product/prd.md)**: Detailed product requirements and personas.

## Technical Documentation
*   **[Technical Reference](./architecture/trd.md)**: Deep dive into the architecture, invariants, and API.
*   **[State Machine](./architecture/state-machine.md)**: The canonical execution lifecycle.

## Governance
*   **[OSS Philosophy](./governance/oss-philosophy.md)**: Open Core principles and licensing.
*   **[Roadmap](./governance/roadmap.md)**: What we are building next.

## Executive Context

For readers evaluating Gantral from an enterprise, platform, risk, or regulatory perspective, we maintain a small set of executive briefings that provide higher-level context on:

*  what the system is and is not,
*  how workflows change after adoption,
*  how it scales across teams,
*  and how execution-time governance is enforced.

These materials are not required to understand, use, or contribute to the open-source project.

**[Executive Briefings](./executive/README.md)**


Gantral is an independent open-source project and is not affiliated with the CNCF.  
Design and governance choices are informed by CNCF best practices.
