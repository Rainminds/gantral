# Gantral Documentation

This directory contains the public-facing documentation for Gantral.

> [!NOTE]
> This structure is a placeholder. Documentation will be migrated to a Docusaurus-based site in future iterations.

## Structure (Planned)

We intend to structure the documentation as follows:

*   **Concepts**: High-level architectural concepts and mental models.
*   **Guides**: Step-by-step tutorials and how-to guides.
*   **Reference**: API specifications, CLI commands, and configuration options.
*   **Deployment**: Instructions for deploying Gantral on various platforms.

For now, please refer to the `specs/` directory in the repository root for technical specifications and the `README.md` for getting started.
