# Welcome to Gantral

**Gantral** is the open-source **AI Execution Control Plane**. It allows teams and enterprises to standardize, govern, and audit AI agent workflows across teams.

> **"We don’t help you build agents. We help you run AI safely across your organization."**

## Quick Start
*   **[What is Gantral?](./positioning/what-is-gantral.md)**: High-level overview and philosophy.
*   **[What Gantral is Not](./positioning/what-gantral-is-not.md)**: Clarifying boundaries vs Agent Frameworks.
*   **[Product Spec](./product/prd.md)**: Detailed product requirements and personas.

## Integration Guides
*   **[Consumer Guide](./guides/example-consumer-integration.md)**: Normative guide for agents integrating with Gantral.
*   **[Policy Integration](./guides/opa-integration.md)**: How to write and enforce OPA policies.
*   **[Demo Walkthrough](./guides/demo.md)**: Running the reference examples.

## Technical Architecture
*   **[Technical Reference (TRD)](./architecture/trd.md)**: Deep dive into the architecture, invariants, and API.
*   **[State Machine](./architecture/state-machine.md)**: The canonical execution lifecycle.
*   **[Implementation Guide](./architecture/implementation-guide.md)**: Reference guide for builders.

## Roadmap & Progress
*   **[Phase-wise Build Plan](./product/phase-wise-build-plan.md)**: Current build status and detailed execution plan.
*   **[Roadmap](./governance/roadmap.md)**: Future features and strategic direction.

## Governance & Contributing
*   **[OSS Philosophy](./governance/oss-philosophy.md)**: Open Core principles.
*   **[How to Contribute](./contributors/how-to-contribute.md)**: Guidelines for code and documentation contributions.

## Executive Context

For readers evaluating Gantral from an enterprise, platform, risk, or regulatory perspective, we maintain a small set of executive briefings that provide higher-level context on:

*  what the system is and is not,
*  how workflows change after adoption,
*  how it scales across teams,
*  and how execution-time governance is enforced.

These materials are not required to understand, use, or contribute to the open-source project.
