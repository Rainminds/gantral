## What This Paper Demonstrates

- Deterministic authority state machine
- Explicit transition relation
- Cryptographic commitment artifact chaining
- Policy separation via OPA
- Replay independent of runtime or logs
- Operational unification of authority semantics

## Relationship to Other Papers

Gantral is part of a trilogy:

1. AI Execution Control Plane — category definition
2. Admissible Execution — normative invariants
3. Gantral Implementation — concrete, open-source implementation satisfying those invariants
