# Getting Started

Welcome to the Gantral project.

Gantral is an open-source AI Execution Control Plane focused on execution semantics, human oversight, and auditability for AI-enabled workflows.

This guide explains how to explore the project and contribute responsibly.

---

## Who This Project Is For

Gantral is primarily intended for:

- Platform engineers
- Infrastructure architects
- Security and governance engineers
- Contributors interested in execution control, not agent intelligence

If you are looking to build AI agents, optimize prompts, or experiment with autonomous workflows, Gantral may not be the right project.

## How to Explore the Project

Start with the following documents:

1. **Positioning**
   - What Gantral is
   - What Gantral is not
   - Category definition
   - Expansion narrative

2. **Architecture**
   - Technical Reference Document (TRD)
   - Execution plane model
   - Architectural invariants

3. **Governance**
   - Open source philosophy
   - License commitment
   - RFC process

These documents describe architectural intent and design principles.  
They are the authoritative reference for evaluating changes.

---

## Repository Overview

The Gantral repository is organized around a **specs-first model**.

Specifications and design precede implementation.

Code that diverges from documented semantics should be treated as incorrect, even if it appears to function.

---

## Before You Contribute

Before proposing changes, contributors are expected to:

- Read the architectural invariants
- Understand the execution model and HITL semantics
- Review existing RFCs (if any)
- Confirm that the proposed change aligns with Gantral’s scope

This project prioritizes correctness and clarity over speed.
