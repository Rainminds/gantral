# How to Contribute

Gantral welcomes contributions that strengthen its core mission:  
**clear, auditable, and governable AI execution.**

Not all contributions are appropriate for the core.

This document explains how to contribute effectively.

---

## Types of Contributions Encouraged

The following contributions are generally welcome:

- Documentation improvements
- Bug fixes
- Test coverage enhancements
- Reference implementations
- SDK improvements
- Adapters and integrations
- Tooling that improves auditability or correctness

All contributions should be narrowly scoped and well explained.

---

## Contributions That Require Extra Review

The following changes typically require deeper review and may require an RFC:

- Execution state machine changes
- HITL semantics or transitions
- Policy evaluation behavior
- Audit or replay mechanisms
- Public API or specification changes
- Architectural invariants

Submission does not imply acceptance.

## Contribution Workflow

1. Open an issue describing the proposed change
2. Discuss scope and alignment with maintainers
3. Submit a pull request with:
   - Clear motivation
   - Explicit non-goals
   - Tests where applicable
4. Address feedback from maintainers

Maintainers may request revisions, defer changes, or decline contributions.

---

## Review and Acceptance

All contributions are reviewed by maintainers.

Acceptance decisions are based on:

- Alignment with architectural principles
- Impact on auditability and control
- Long-term maintainability
- Risk of introducing ambiguity or autonomy

There is no guarantee that any contribution will be merged.

## Contributor Conduct

Contributors are expected to engage respectfully and professionally.

Disagreement is normal. Entitlement is not.

Maintainers reserve the right to moderate discussions and contributions to protect the integrity of the project.

Contributor behavior is governed by the project’s Code of Conduct (see CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
