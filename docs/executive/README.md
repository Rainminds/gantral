# Executive Briefings

For readers evaluating Gantral from an enterprise, platform, risk, or
regulatory perspective, we maintain a small set of executive briefings
that explain:

- what the system is (at a high level),
- how workflows change after adoption,
- how it scales across teams,
- and how governance and oversight are enforced.

These materials are **not required** to understand, use, or contribute to
the open-source project. They are provided as optional context for
enterprise and regulatory discussions.
