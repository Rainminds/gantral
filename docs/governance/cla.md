# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

To protect contributors and users of Gantral, the project requires a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for code contributions.

This document explains what the CLA is and why it exists.

---

## Why a CLA Is Required

Gantral is infrastructure that may be used by enterprises in regulated environments.

A CLA helps ensure that:

- Contributions can be legally distributed
- Intellectual property rights are clear
- Enterprises can adopt the project with confidence
- Contributors retain appropriate rights to their work

The CLA protects both contributors and the project.

---

## What the CLA Covers

By signing the CLA, contributors confirm that:

- They have the right to submit the contributed code or documentation
- The contribution is original or properly licensed
- The project is granted the right to use, modify, and distribute the contribution under the project’s license

The CLA does **not** transfer ownership of contributions.

---

## What the CLA Does Not Do

The CLA does not:

- Assign your copyright to the project
- Prevent you from using your contribution elsewhere
- Create an employment, partnership, or agency relationship
- Grant special influence over project direction

---

## Individual vs Corporate CLA

Gantral may support:

- **Individual CLA (ICLA)** for personal contributions
- **Corporate CLA (CCLA)** for contributions made as part of employment

Details will be provided during the contribution process.

---

## When a CLA Is Required

A CLA is typically required:

- Before merging code contributions
- For changes to core execution semantics, APIs, or specifications

Documentation-only contributions may not require a CLA, depending on scope.

---

## How to Sign the CLA

The project will provide a simple, electronic CLA process.

Signing instructions will be linked from the repository once enabled.
