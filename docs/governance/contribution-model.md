title: Contribution Model

# Contribution Model

Gantral welcomes contributions that strengthen its core mission.

Not all contributions are appropriate for the core.

---

## Types of Contributions Encouraged

- Bug fixes
- Documentation improvements
- Reference implementations
- SDK enhancements
- Adapters and integrations
- Test coverage and tooling

---

## Contributions That Require Extra Scrutiny

- Changes to execution semantics
- HITL behavior modifications
- Policy evaluation logic
- Audit and replay mechanisms

These typically require an RFC.

---

## Contributor Expectations

Contributors are expected to:

- Respect architectural invariants
- Avoid introducing hidden autonomy
- Prefer declarative over imperative logic
- Write code that is readable and auditable
- Accept maintainer feedback without entitlement

---

## Why This Model Exists

Gantral is infrastructure, not a playground.

Contributions are welcomed, but not all ideas belong in the execution core.

Clarity protects contributors as much as maintainers.
