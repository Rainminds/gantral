# License Commitment

Gantral is licensed under the **Apache License, Version 2.0**.

This license applies to the Gantral open-source core. It reflects the project’s long-term licensing intent.

---

## Why Apache 2.0

Apache 2.0 was chosen because it provides:

- Explicit patent protection
- Enterprise-friendly terms
- Compatibility with commercial use
- Clear separation between open and proprietary components

This license is widely accepted by:

- Large enterprises
- Cloud providers
- Regulated organizations
- Open-source foundations

---

## Non-Negotiable Commitment

Gantral makes the following commitments:

- The project intends for the open-source core to remain licensed under Apache 2.0.
- There will be no license change to a restrictive or “source-available” model
- There will be no retroactive re-licensing of existing contributions
- There will be no dual-license bait-and-switch

These commitments exist to protect users, contributors, and adopters.

---

## Scope of the License

Apache 2.0 applies to:

- Execution state machine
- HITL semantics
- Policy evaluation logic
- Core APIs and SDKs
- Specifications and reference implementations

Commercial offerings may exist separately and are clearly delineated.

## Why This Matters

License instability has repeatedly destroyed trust in infrastructure projects.

Gantral’s license commitment is designed to eliminate uncertainty at the outset, so adopters can invest with confidence.

Trust is not earned retroactively.

This statement expresses project intent and does not constitute a legally binding guarantee.
