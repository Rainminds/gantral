# Open Source Philosophy

Gantral is open source by design, not by distribution.

This project exists at the infrastructure layer of enterprise AI adoption.  
Infrastructure that controls execution, approvals, and audit is typically expected to be inspectable in order to earn trust.

Open source is therefore a structural requirement, not a community growth tactic.

## Why Gantral Is Open Source

Gantral sits at a sensitive control boundary:

- It enforces human authority over AI decisions
- It records audit and execution evidence
- It governs cost, policy, and accountability

Enterprises — especially regulated ones — do not trust closed control planes for these responsibilities.

Open source enables:

- Verifiability of execution semantics
- Independent security review
- Regulator and auditor confidence
- Long-term ecosystem trust

Without openness, Gantral would not be viable in its intended environments.

## What “Open” Means in Practice

For Gantral, open source means:

- Core execution semantics are public
- HITL logic is inspectable
- Policy enforcement is transparent
- Audit guarantees are verifiable
- Specifications lead implementations

Open source is not used as a growth funnel or marketing artifact.  
It is the **operating model** of the project.

## What Open Source Does Not Mean

Open source does not mean:

- No commercial offerings
- No governance or stewardship
- No roadmap ownership
- No differentiation between core and platform

Gantral follows an **open core** model where trust-critical infrastructure is open, and usability, scale, and enterprise experience can be commercial.

This separation is intentional and explicit.

## Long-Term Orientation

Gantral is designed to outlive individual vendors.

The project favors:

- Stability over novelty
- Predictability over rapid iteration
- Governance clarity over speed

These values are incompatible with closed, opaque systems.

They are compatible with open infrastructure.
