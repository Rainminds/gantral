# Roadmap Principles

Gantral’s roadmap is guided by principles, not feature lists.

This document explains how prioritization decisions are made.

---

## What the Roadmap Optimizes For

The roadmap prioritizes:

- Execution control correctness
- Auditability and replayability
- Clear authority boundaries
- Enterprise and regulator trust
- Long-term maintainability

Speed and breadth are secondary.

---

## What the Roadmap Explicitly Avoids

The roadmap avoids:

- Feature accumulation without control rationale
- Agent intelligence improvements
- UI-led prioritization
- Vendor-specific optimizations
- Claims of full autonomy

Gantral is not a race to match agent builders.

---

## How Features Are Evaluated

A proposed feature must answer:

- Does this improve execution control?
- Does this strengthen human authority?
- Does this preserve audit guarantees?
- Does this avoid coupling to specific vendors?
- Does this reduce, not increase, ambiguity?

If the answer is unclear, the feature is deferred or rejected.

## Phased Evolution

Gantral evolves by deepening control, not widening scope.

- Phase 1: HITL as a first-class execution primitive
- Phase 2: Process-aware orchestration
- Phase 3: Org-level governance
- Phase 4: Neutral ecosystem and standards

Each phase builds on the previous one.

---

## Roadmap Authority

Roadmap authority remains with the maintainers.

This ensures:

- Coherent execution semantics
- Predictable evolution
- Protection against scope drift

Community input informs the roadmap.  
Maintainers own it.
