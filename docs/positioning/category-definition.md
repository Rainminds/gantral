Gantral defines a new category:

**AI Execution Control Plane**

This category is distinct from existing AI tooling markets.

---

## What Exists Today

Most AI platforms are **agent-centric**:

- Agent builders focus on creating intelligent behavior
- Observability tools focus on monitoring outputs
- Governance registries focus on cataloging agents

Enterprises, however, operate in a **process- and accountability-centric** model.

This mismatch creates execution chaos at scale.

---

## The Missing Layer

What is missing is a shared, infrastructure-level control layer that:

- Enforces who can decide
- Records what was decided
- Governs how AI participates in processes
- Decouples policy from agent code

This is the AI Execution Control Plane.

## How Gantral Differs

| Dimension | Agent Builders | Governance Tools | Gantral |
|---------|---------------|------------------|---------|
| **Execution Model** | PaaS / Hosting | Metadata Only | **Federated Runners** (Your Infra) |
| Focus | Intelligence | Inventory & policy | Execution & authority |
| Unit of Control | Agent | Agent | Instance |
| HITL | Optional / ad-hoc | Reported | Enforced via execution-state transitions |
| Audit | Logs & traces | Metadata | Deterministic replay |
| Scope | Single workflow | Registry-level | Cross-process |

Gantral does not compete on intelligence.

It competes on **control**.

## Why This Category Matters Now

This category is emerging in response to observable enterprise adoption patterns.

1. AI adoption across material workflows
2. Regulatory pressure on AI decisions
3. Cost, accountability, and audit requirements at scale

As with containers, infrastructure-level control emerges only after chaos becomes visible.

Gantral exists because that point has been reached.
