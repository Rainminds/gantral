# Expansion Narrative

Gantral is built as infrastructure.

Infrastructure does not launch fully formed.  
It expands by owning the most critical control points first.

This document describes architectural direction and intent. It does not constitute a commitment to deliver specific features or timelines.

---

## Phase 1: HITL as an Execution Primitive (Now)

Focus:
- Human-in-the-Loop as a state transition
- Deterministic execution and audit
- SDLC-adjacent workflows (code review, incidents)

Why:
Every material AI workflow eventually requires a human decision.
Today, this is handled via Slack messages, emails, and ad-hoc dashboards.

Gantral is designed to standardize this boundary.

---

## Phase 2: Process Awareness (Next)

Focus:
- Process-aware orchestration across SDLC stages
- Cross-step context propagation
- Team-level visibility and SLAs

Why:
Once human decisions are enforced, workflows naturally need structure.
Control expands from decisions to process context.

---

## Phase 3: Org-Level Governance

Focus:
- Materiality-based policy enforcement
- Cost attribution and routing
- Compliance and audit automation

Why:
At scale, enterprises need centralized governance without blocking teams.
Policies must be enforced structurally, not socially.

---

## Phase 4: Ecosystem and Neutral Governance

Focus:
- Open standards and specifications
- Foundation-style governance
- Broad ecosystem integration

Why:
Execution control infrastructure must be neutral to be trusted long-term.

## What This Narrative Is (and Is Not)

This is:
- A statement of architectural direction
- A claim on long-term territory
- A guardrail against scope creep

This is not:
- A delivery roadmap
- A feature promise
- A sales commitment

Gantral expands by deepening control, not by accumulating features.
