# What Gantral Is Not

Clear boundaries are essential for infrastructure.

Gantral explicitly does **not** attempt to solve everything related to AI, SDLC automation, or agent development.

If Gantral tried to do these things, it would fail at its core mission: execution control.

---

## Gantral Is NOT an Agent Builder

Gantral does not:

- Build AI agents
- Optimize prompts
- Select or fine-tune models
- Compete with agent frameworks

Agent frameworks evolve quickly.  
Execution control must remain stable.

Gantral intentionally sits *above* agent builders and works with them.

---

## Gantral Is NOT an End-to-End SDLC Automation Platform

Gantral does not:

- Replace CI/CD systems
- Replace GitHub, Jira, or ServiceNow
- Claim to automate the entire SDLC autonomously
- Promise “AI-run engineering organizations”

Gantral governs **decisions within workflows**, not the workflows themselves.

---

## Gantral Is NOT an Observability or Analytics Tool

Gantral does not:

- Benchmark model quality
- Measure accuracy, precision, or recall
- Optimize agent performance
- Replace AgentOps or observability platforms

Gantral may consume observability signals, but it does not own them.

---

## Gantral Is NOT a UI-First Product

Gantral does not prioritize:

- Visual workflow builders
- No-code orchestration
- Dashboard-driven configuration

Declarative configuration and explicit execution semantics take precedence over convenience.

---

## Gantral Is NOT Autonomous AI Infrastructure

Gantral does not:

- Allow AI to bypass human authority
- Support self-approving execution loops
- Replace accountability with automation

Human authority is treated as final within Gantral’s execution model by design.

If a workflow is material, Gantral enforces HITL — not optional review.

---

## Why These Non-Goals Matter

Most AI platforms fail enterprise adoption not because they lack features, but because they lack **clear limits**.

Gantral’s non-goals are deliberate.

They ensure that Gantral remains:

- Auditable
- Regulator-compatible
- Trustworthy in high-stakes environments
- Compatible with a wide ecosystem

If a use case requires autonomy without accountability, Gantral is not the right tool.

That is a feature, not a limitation.
